' Operators in VBScript 

'type of operators: 

'i) Arithmetic:
Dim a, b
a = 10  
b = 20
Dim sum, diff, product, quotient, modulus, exponent
'Addition "+":
sum = a + b  
WScript.Echo sum
msgbox "Addition: "&sum
'Subtraction "-":
diff = b - a 
WScript.Echo diff
msgbox "Subtraction: " & diff
'Multiplication "*":
product = a * b 
WScript.Echo product
msgbox "Multiplication: " & product
'Division "/":
quotient = b / a 
WScript.Echo quotient
msgbox "Division: " & quotient
'Modulus "Mod" or "%":
modulus = b Mod a
WScript.Echo modulus
msgbox "Modulus: " & modulus
'Exponentiation "^":
exponent = a ^ 2
WScript.Echo exponent
msgbox "Exponentiation: " & exponent

'ii) Comparison

'ii) Concatenation

'iv) Logical
